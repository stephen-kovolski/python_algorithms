# python_algorithms
I created this repository to work onm my Python skills.
I've seen tutorials in the past and have read about syntax and functional programing with Python
But it's time to dive in make it happen.

This repo is strictly algortihms with no class, tutorial or guidance.  
Im relaying only on myslef, and the bits and peices I look up to make the bigger picture happen. 

All algorithms go a step or two further.  esch one will have a command line interface to make each algo a mini program.  It will ask the user questions and based on their answer will direct them through the algorithm/program.

This algorithm asks for me to convert a number into a string.
it takes input from the user and asks whether the user wants to conver a number into a string or a string into a number.  If the user doesnt input the correct choice, the program asks the user to please stick to only choosing a string or integer to convert.

This algorithm asks to take two inegers and add them.  Relatively easy.
Turned it into a CLI but without a function.
I was successful and needed to turn the answers given from strings to integers in order to get the correct answer. 
Lastely I used a function with the CLI and called the function in order to make this algorithm work. 
Completed this algortim in 2 different ways.
